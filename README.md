Project Name: MAZE

Description:
A maze game. You can choose from 3 modes and 3 levels of difficulty.
For all modes, the arrow keys are used to move the player, and a randomly placed dot marks the goal (when reached,
score increases by 1 and new maze generated). 
If the chosen mode is timed and has enemies, player must reach the goal before time runs out or they get caught by an enemy.

	Absolutism mode (timed, has enemies):
	Easy: 30 secs to complete each maze & 1 enemy, Medium: 20 secs & 2 enemies, Hard: 10 secs & 3 enemies

	Eternalism mode (no time limit):
	Easy: No enemies, Medium: One enemy, Hard: 3 enemies

	Idealism mode (timed, as time runs out enemies multiply. Collecting hearts defeats enemies):
	Easy: 30 seconds to complete each maze, Medium: 20 seconds, Hard: 10 seconds
